# npindi

Native Python Indi library is an implementation of the INDI library written in pure Python. It does not rely on 
an underlying C/C++ INDI library as [pyindi-client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyindi-client) does. 
At the moment it only implements the client side of the INDI library. I may also implement the driver side later.

** This project is at a very first stage, the API for scripting clients should be refined. **
